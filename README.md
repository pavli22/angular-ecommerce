# Simple E-Commerce Project with Angular

This is a **mini e-commerce application** built using Angular and the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The project currently features a **product page** where all products are fetched from the API and displayed in a clean, responsive layout.

## Project Overview

The application is designed to serve as a **starter template for e-commerce platforms** and was built with scalability in mind. The structure, folder organization, and design choices make it easy to extend the project in the future by adding more features, components, and pages.

## Features

- **API Integration**: The product data is fetched from the Fake Store API, simulating real-world product listings.
- **Product Page**: Displays all available products from the API in an organized, stylish layout.
- **Angular Interceptors**: Used to manage HTTP requests, add headers, and handle potential errors.
- **Custom Pipes**: For transforming data in the template, such as formatting prices or filtering content.
- **Well-Organized Folder Structure**: Designed with scalability in mind, making it easy to add features in the future.

## Future Enhancements

This project is structured for future extensions, such as:

- **Shopping Cart**: Add to cart functionality, displaying selected products, and updating quantities.
- **Product Filters**: Filtering products by category, price, or rating.
- **User Authentication**: User login, registration, and profile management.
- **Checkout Process**: A complete checkout page with order summary, payment integration, and order confirmation.
- **Product Reviews**: Displaying and adding reviews for products.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: For building a robust and scalable single-page application.
- **Angular HTTPClient & Interceptors**: To fetch data from the API and manage HTTP requests efficiently.
- **CSS & Bootstrap & Angular Styling**: For a responsive and clean product display.
